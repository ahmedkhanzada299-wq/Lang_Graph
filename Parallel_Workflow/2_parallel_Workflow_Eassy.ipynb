       " 'language_feedback': \"The essay presents a clear viewpoint on India's relationship with artificial intelligence (AI) but suffers from significant language quality issues. The writing includes many grammatical mistakes, awkward phrasing, and informal language that detracts from the overall clarity and professionalism expected in an essay. For instance, phrases like 'new tech call Artificial Intel… something (AI)' and 'if no careful, India go back' are grammatically incorrect and awkwardly constructed.  Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions such as 'big big data' and 'go back' gives the essay an informal tone that is not suitable for a formal analysis. The structure of the essay is somewhat disorganized, with ideas jumping around without smooth transitions. There are also typos, such as 'engine-ear' instead of 'engineers,' which suggest a lack of proofreading. Furthermore, while the points made about AI's potential benefits and challenges for India are relevant, they could be expanded with more depth or examples to enhance the argument's quality. Overall, the essay shows potential but requires significant edits for grammar, organization, and vocabulary choices to improve clarity and effectiveness.\",\n",
       " 'analysis_feedback': 'The essay presents some interesting initial ideas about the potential of AI in India, touching on both benefits and challenges. However, the depth of analysis is quite limited. The points made seem broadly acknowledged but lack detailed exploration or specific evidence to substantiate claims. For instance, while mentioning the benefits of AI in farming and healthcare is a good start, the essay does not provide statistics, examples, or specific case studies to support these assertions. Furthermore, the discussion of the challenges related to privacy and job loss is somewhat vague and simplistic. There is a need for more thorough articulation of these issues, perhaps by discussing potential solutions or examples from other countries. The language used is also quite simplistic, which undermines the sophistication of the analysis. Overall, while the essay touches on crucial issues, deeper engagement with the themes presented and stronger supporting arguments would greatly enhance its quality. \\nOverall Score: 4 out of 10',\n",

However, the clarity of thought is compromised due to several grammatical mistakes, sentence structure issues, and a lack of coherence in the arguments presented. There are instances of informal language, such as ‘big big data’ and phrases like ‘go back’ that detract from the overall professionalism of the essay. \\n\\nThe writer presents relevant points, such as India’s strengths in technology and education, the benefits of AI in various sectors (agriculture, health, education), and significant challenges (accessibility, job loss, privacy concerns). However, these points could be elaborated further for depth and clarity. The argument lacks a well-structured flow, making it difficult for readers to follow the writer's line of reasoning. Technical terms like ‘AI’, while introduced, are not fully explained, assuming reader familiarity without context. \\n\\nMoreover, the conclusion tightly summarizes the major themes but fails to reinforce them effectively or suggest actionable points. In future drafts, more attention should be given to organizing thoughts logically, enhancing vocabulary, and refining grammar. \\n\\nOverall, the essay reflects an understanding of the subject but struggles with clarity and coherence, impacting its effectiveness.\",\n",
